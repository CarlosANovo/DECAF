## Inspiration
   Not a single car sharing service today really connects to you. You enter the car, go wherever you want, you get off the car. It's not fun. People are changing from ownership to usership, but these services are not as fun and immersive as they should. *Volvo* proposed we found a way to gamify the car sharing service and *Swisscom* challenged us to create *a platform that performs a digital representation of an asset as a data-bound utility token that can be used within your platform*. Our solution is both **DECAF and VOLT**, which work together to provide the people a decentralized car-sharing platform that makes our inner gamer smile.
## What it does

### Decentralized car sharing made fun
   **DECAF** is an Ethereum based platform that provides car manufacturers a way to enter the car-sharing business. Brands add cars to the network and receive tokens doing so. The more cars a brand adds for sharing on DECAF, the more tokens get distributed to the brand. These tokens are then given to users based on use-time, streaks of use, achievements, quests. DECAF tokens are by definition backed by cars.
   
   #### How to win tokens
     
   By requesting and using cars, by completing certain quests or unlocking achievements you can win XP and each time you level up you win tokens. The tokens you receive can be given by more than one brand depending whose quests you completed or by the time you used each brand's cars. There are also special quests which give XP aswell as tokens.
   
   #### How to spend tokens
  Tokens can be spent by users to enhance their experience. They can then be used to get discounts or even free rides on the platform, get discounts in, for example, VOLVO experiencies (free museum visit, discount on an oil change), discounts or vouchers of other services that want to partner with our platform. For example, a restaurant or a zoo might want to offer a discount for certain tokens for the exposure it will have in our platform.
  
  #### Social
  When you request a car, you have the option to tell the platform where you are going. If another person is requesting a ride to go the same way, you can both accept sharing the car to share the expense. You can see each other profiles and see if you have the same interests.
  DECAF also makes you compete with your friends or people in the same area to get on top of the leaderboard. You can win extra tokens for being the best.
  
### Volvo token
   **VOLT** is how we imagine a car manufacturer implementing on top of our platform. VOLVO adds cars to our platform that can then be requested by the users, they can also add quests and achievements their users can unlock, to improve user experience and make people want to use their services. If a user levels-up Volvo will give them tokens based on how he used VOLT, the same being true if a user completes a certain special Volvo quest.
   This app adds fun and rewards to car sharing, making car sharing a service people will love to use.
   
   By developing on top of DECAF Volvo will fullfill once again their legacy of always being ahead and focusing on the user.
   
## How I built it
   We developed a smart-contract using Ethereum. While we didn't quite finish everything we had planned, we got to learn a lot about blockchain techonlogies and how we develop on top of them. It was the first time using something on top of a crypto, so it we were happy with the progress and with what we had working in the end.
   The app was made using web technologies to be easy to port between devices.
