## Inspiration
   Not a single car sharing service today really connects to you. You enter the car, go wherever you want, you get off the car. It's not fun. People are changing from ownership to usership, but these services are not as fun and immersive as they should. *Volvo* proposed we found a way to gamify the car sharing service and *Swisscom* challenged us to create *a platform that performs a digital representation of an asset as a data-bound utility token that can be used within your platform*. Our solution is both **DECAF and VOLT**, which work together to provide the people a decentralized car-sharing platform that makes our inner gamer smile.
## What it does

### Decentralized car sharing made fun
   **DECAF** is an Ethereum based platform that provides car manufacturers a way to enter the car-sharing business. Brands add cars to the network and receive tokens doing so. The more cars a brand has on DECAF, the more token get distributed to the brand. These tokens are then given to users based on use-time, streaks of use, achievements, quests. 
   ### How to win tokens
     
   By requesting and using cars, by completing certain quests or unlocking acheivements you can win XP and each time you level up you win tokens. The tokens you receive can be given by more than one brand depending whose quests you completed or by the time you used each brand car's.
